#exercise of module 2 at course arduino platform.
##Course developed by the University of California, Irvine for the Coursera.

Write a program that causes the built-in LED connected to pin 13 on the Arduino to blink, alternating between fast blinks and slow blinks. The LED should blink 5 times, once every half second, and then it should blink 5 more times, once every two seconds. The LED should continue to blink in this alternating fashion for as long as the Arduino receives power.

Make sure your program compiles!
